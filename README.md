# Magprobe-HX
This is a redesign based on the Salveoo's Magprobe for KW11/KW-12/KW-4 microswitches. The goal of this project was to create a better Magprobe that will be able to probe the hot bed after heat soaking and thermal equilibrium is achieved. It is consistent in performance and more resistant to temperature cycles of the 3D printer than the other probes available in the same segment.
